# olx-observedads-notes
Chrome extension. Lets You add notes to adds observed on OLX.

# Intro
Sometimes You look for a really weird stuff on the OLX. You finally found Your precious item, but the description is rather poor. You call the seller, and he gives You the information You need, but there is no place to store it in the add. 
This extension solves that issue - it lets You add notes to the observed adds, so You won't miss a thing.

# How it works
Simply go to the observed adds panel and notes under the adds, like on the picture below
